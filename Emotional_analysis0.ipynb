        "# Emotional Sentiment Analysis and Adaptive Response System\n",
        "\n",
        "In this project, we will build a chatbot capable of identifying and understanding emotional states from text input. The system will analyze user input to detect emotions such as fear, joy, sadness, and more. Based on the detected emotion, the chatbot will generate culturally sensitive and empathetic responses.\n",
        "\n",
        "Steps Involved:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.**Data Collection & Preprocessing**: We will load a dataset containing text data labeled with emotions and preprocess it for model training.\n",
        "\n",
        "2**.Model Training**: Using a machine learning model (e.g., Logistic Regression), we will classify the emotional state of the input text.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.**Response Generation**: After detecting the emotion, the chatbot will generate relevant responses tailored to the emotional context.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.**Integration & Testing**: Finally, we will integrate the sentiment analysis model with the response generation system and test the chatbotâ€™s performance.\n",
        "The goal is to create an empathetic chatbot that understands emotional cues and responds appropriately, providing emotional support."
